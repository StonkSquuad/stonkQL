# StonkQL

StonkQL was developed by the StonkSquuad as a 24 hour Dynatrace Innovation day project. The goal for the team was to learn how to use GraphQL and the visx React visualization library from AirBnb in a fullstack application. The financial metrics are pulled from the [Polygon.io](https://polygon.io) stock API.
